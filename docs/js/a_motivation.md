# Computer, a utility
In order to create an understanding about programming, one must need to grasp the utilization of a computer machine.A computer machine is nothing more than an ordinary tool like `A Car`.A computer consumes `data` in the same way a car consumes `fuel`.If you want to drive a car, you must need to know about the driving process so that you can utilize the car in a way you want it to be.
As we said earlier, computer is also a utility so if it is a utility then it must have an operating process like driving process of a car. 

## Driving Process

In order to drive a car one must need to interact with it like sitting on a driver seat, revolve a staring etc so if one wants to use(drive) a computer then it also needs to be interacted.A person interacts with computer in the same way he/she interacts with another person which means through a language but in the context of computers we use the term `computer language`.A computer language is a medium by which a computer can be operated and utilized.

## Data Utilization
A computer utilize data in one or all of the following three ways:
1. Uses Data Structures for its storage( variables, arrays, dictionary, Object etc )
2. Take decisions based on data (control statements if, if-else, switch)
3. Apply a process on bunch of data (Repetitions, for loop )

A computer language is needed to communicate with a computer so that one can control the above mentioned data utilization
processes so that a software can be build according to our required needs.
